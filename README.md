# QIM Notebooks Collection

A collection of Jupyter Notebooks for working with volumetric 3D data using `qim3d`.

These notebooks demonstrate common workflows, analysis patterns, visualization techniques, and teaching material from the Qim Center. They are designed to help researchers, students, and developers reproduce examples, learn by doing, and extend the library for new use cases.

The `qim3d` library includes tools for loading and manipulating 3D image data, processing and filtering, visualization and interactive viewing, and advanced analysis routines. Learn more in the documentation: https://docs.qim.dk/qim3d/

## Getting Started

To run any of the notebooks in this collection, you only need to install qim3d.
Installation instructions can be found here: https://docs.qim.dk/qim3d/#installation

Once qim3d is installed, you can open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and run them directly.
